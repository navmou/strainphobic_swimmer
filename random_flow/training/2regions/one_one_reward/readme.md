# training with discrete reward function and multiple random flows

- file names follow the convention {signal}.cpp
- plotting scripts are to plot the reward sum plot and find the top policy
- heat maps are to plot the heat maps of the policies found

## field-read.h 
Loads the flow data.

## submit.h
Is a sample script to submit the jobs in cluster. 
(Edit for each signal by putting the correct policies)
